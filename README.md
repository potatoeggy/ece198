## Usage

**This crate uses features from Rust nightly! Make sure you switch before running:**

```
rustup toolchain install nightly
``` 

Cargo and STLink are required to build and flash the program:

```
cd ece198
cargo install cargo-flash
cargo install --path .
cargo flash --target STM32F4xxx

Pin layout is described in `main.rs` and you can probably figure out the hardware used from that.
